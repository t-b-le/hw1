    <h1>Welcome to ThienTran's Website!</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to give people a general rundown of who I am! :></p>

    <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
    <h3>1. I like playing videogames!</h3>
    <p>In my free time and in between studying for classes, I like to play videogames!
       Some of my favorites that have a special place in my heart include Hollow Knight, 
       League of Legends, and Genshin Impact!
       Below is a picture of me playing Genshin Impact next to one of my favorite 
       characters in game!
    </p>

    <h3>2. I'm not very good at videogames!</h3>
    <p>Despite my enjoyment of videogames, I'm actually not very good. It's a new hobby
       I got into recently, so while I'm not ranked very high in terms of my gameplay, 
       I enjoy learning how to get better with every game!
       Below are a few pictures from my matches, sourced from the website 
       <a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/hanaaham"><span style="cursor:help">op.gg</span></a>
       as it records all of my matchups every season!

    <h3>3. I like manga/manhwa/manhua!</h3>
    <p>This has been a lifelong hobby of mine! For those who don't know what it is, it's 
       East Asian animation/comic books, mainly from Japan, South Korea, and China. It's 
       It's been something that has helped me cheer up when things are down. There truly isn't 
       anything better than a couple of warm blankets, curled up with a good manga!
       Below is a picture from one of my favorite manhwas, Eleceed! Can you tell he's one of my
       favorite characters?

    <h2>Some Projects I've Done</h2>
    <!--<h3><a href="https://github.com/t-b-le"><span style="cursor:help">Image Encoder</span></a></h3>-->
    <h3>Image Encoder</h3>
    <p>This project I made in January 2022 is one of my favorites! The project had me 
       working with RBG values within each pixel of an image and encrypt the image. It
       was a very interesting project that helped introduce me to C++ as well as the 
       SFML library. 
    </p>

    <!--<h3><a href="https://github.com/t-b-le"><span style="cursor:wait">Serpinski Triangle</span></a></h3>-->
    <h3>Serpinski Triangle</h3>
    <p>This is another one of my projects that I am very proud of! This project was 
       similar to the Image Encoder project in that I was still very new to C++ and 
       the SFML library, but this project was a full of a little more math! I had to 
       figure out how to recreate a Serpinski Triangle using recursion, and it kind of
       had me going back to remember my trigonometry, which I had a lot of fun doing!

    <h2>Some of My Hobbies/Interests</h2>
    <h3>
      Machine Learning
    </h3>
    <p>Over the summer of 2023, I was fortunate enough to be able to work on a research 
       project that had focused on robotics, and incorporating that into pediatric rehab. 
       It was a very fun and interesting project to be a part of, and so I hope that I can 
       make some time in the future to work more on it, even if it is just as a hobby!

    </button>
    <p>It was only after I got into Computer Science that I started learning more about 
       machine learning! It's very fascinating stuff and while it is all very complicated
       stuff, I hope that some work I get to work on can work more into machine learning!

    <p>As I mentioned before, I really like East Asian comic books, so naturally, I've begun 
       to read a new release called Kagura Bachi. It has already started becoming popular and 
       gaining lots of traction, so I've naturally also become very interested in it as well!
